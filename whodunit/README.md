# Questions

## What's `stdint.h`?

It is a header file for  a library that allows for programmers to write more portable code, by providing a set of typedefs that specify
exact-width integer types.

## What's the point of using `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint16_t` in a program?

By declaring these types of integers, it makes it clear that you want to utilize the data in a certain way, whether it being, 8, 32, 16,
or 24 bits in width

## How many bytes is a `BYTE`, a `DWORD`, a `LONG`, and a `WORD`, respectively?

TODO

## What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

TODO

## What's the difference between `bfSize` and `biSize`?

TODO

## What does it mean if `biHeight` is negative?

TODO

## What field in `BITMAPINFOHEADER` specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

TODO

## Why might `fopen` return `NULL` in lines 24 and 32 of `copy.c`?

TODO

## Why is the third argument to `fread` always `1` in our code?

TODO

## What value does line 63 of `copy.c` assign to `padding` if `bi.biWidth` is `3`?

TODO

## What does `fseek` do?

TODO

## What is `SEEK_CUR`?
